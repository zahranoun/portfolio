# Portfolio README - Zahra Nouhehkhan

## Introduction

Welcome to my web portfolio! In this document, I'll provide insights into my development process, challenges faced, lessons learned, and the resources utilized to create this portfolio.

## Development Process

My development process involved several key stages:

1. **Planning**: I began by outlining the goals and objectives of my portfolio, including the design aesthetic, functionality, and target audience by creating a moodboard and sitemap.
2. **Design**: I created a wireframes, prototype and mockups to visualize the layout and user interface of the portfolio.
3. **Development**: Using Bootstrap HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I built the portfolio from scratch, ensuring responsiveness across various devices and browsers.
4. **Testing**: I carefully tested the portfolio to identify and resolve any bugs or issues. Accessibility elements were the most important in the testing process.
5. **Deployment**: Finally, I deployed the portfolio to a hosting service to make it accessible to viewers.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

During development, I encountered several challenges:

1. **Image Optomization**: Images with high resolution and file sizes posed a challenge as they increased page loading times, affecting user experience.
   _Solution_: To address this, I implemented image optimization techniques such as compression using the tool derivv. Additionally, I resized images to appropriate dimensions without reducing quality, reducing file sizes while maintaining visual integrity.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensuring accessibility for all users, especially those with disabilities, presented a significant challenge. Incorporating accessibility features and leveraging ARIA roles proved to be a complex yet essential aspect of this endeavor.
   _Solution_: To address this challenge, I dedicated time to research and familiarize myself with accessibility guidelines and best practices. I consulted resources such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and ARIA Authoring Practices to understand the proper use of ARIA roles and attributes. Additionally, I conducted testing with screen readers and assistive technologies to validate the effectiveness of the implemented solutions, making adjustments as necessary.

## Lessons Learned

Creating my web portfolio has been a valuable learning experience. Some key takeaways include:

1. **Effective Time Management**: I learned the importance of prioritizing tasks and managing time efficiently to meet deadlines. Since this was a large project, I had to make sure to start early, while prioitizing other assignmnets and completing them at the same time.
2. **Continuous Learning**: The process of developing this portfolio using Bootstrap code exposed me to new css variables, techniques, and best practices, fostering continuous learning and improvement.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Facing and overcoming challenges during development enhanced my problem-solving skills and resilience.

## Resources Utilized

I utilized the following assets and resources during the development of my portfolio:

- **Frameworks**: Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling.
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts for typography.
- **Images**: All images were previous projects made by me.

## Conclusion

Creating my web portfolio has been a rewarding journey, allowing me to showcase my skills and achievements while enhancing my development abilities. I look forward to continuing to refine and enhance my portfolio as I grow as a developer.
